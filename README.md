# __3D GEOMETRIC CALCULATOR__

### A simple C-based program that calculates Surface Area and Volume of various 3D shapes. Built nearly 3.5 years ago, back when I was in 9th grade and armed with *literally all* the coding knowledge I had at that point.

## About Me

Hi, my name is Raktim, and Iâ€™m a senior high school student from a Tier 3 town named Pathsala, Assam, India.

Iâ€™ve always been passionate about Math and Programming, and this project was born out of curiosity. Could I build something that felt like a full-fledged math tool using just C?

I made this when I was still in 9th grade, and I had just started exploring programming. So everything I knew â€” from `if-else` to recursion to clearing the screen with `system("cls")` â€” got poured into this one project. If you spot any flaws, they exist purely because I didnâ€™t know any better back then, not because I didnâ€™t care.

**Note:** I didnâ€™t have much idea about Git or GitHub back when I built this. Thatâ€™s why the repo has very few commits. Iâ€™m uploading the project now, years later, just to share it.


___

This app is entirely written in __C__. It was made long before I understood the concepts of clean code or proper software design. And yet, Iâ€™m proud of it because this was the first time I felt like a real programmer.

___

## Why was this made?

Honestly? I just wanted to make something cool. I was learning about surface area and volume in school, and calculators felt boring. So I built my own:

1. It allowed users to choose a shape.
2. Then choose the type of calculation: surface area or volume.
3. It even had input validation and custom feedback.
4. It could run in loops, letting users keep calculating different shapes.

___

## What shapes are supported?

- **Cube**
  - Total Surface Area
  - Curved Surface Area
  - Volume

- **Cuboid**
  - Total Surface Area
  - Curved Surface Area
  - Volume

- **Cylinder**
  - Total Surface Area
  - Curved Surface Area
  - Volume

- **Cone**
  - Total Surface Area
  - Curved Surface Area
  - Volume

- **Sphere**
  - Surface Area
  - Volume

Each option leads to its dedicated function that handles input, computation, and output.

___

## What were the learnings?

1. How to use conditionals and loops to simulate a real app-like experience.
2. Created a UI-like feel using `system("cls")` and custom print menus.
3. Learned about organizing code into small functions for modularity.
4. First exposure to delays, screen clearing, and recursion in C.
5. And most importantly, I learned that obsession with optimisation isnâ€™t always the right kind of smart.

___

## How to run the program?

### Requirements:
- A C compiler like GCC, Turbo C++, or Code::Blocks.
- Works best on Windows (because of `system("cls")` and `conio.h`).

### Steps:
1. Open the `.c` file in your preferred C IDE or editor.
2. Compile and run it.
3. Follow the instructions in the terminal. Itâ€™ll guide you through shape and calculation selection.

Once done, youâ€™ll be asked if you want to continue. Enter `1` for yes and `2` for no.

## Future ideas (Back then)

Hereâ€™s what I had in mind but never built (at least, not exactly the way I originally thought):

- Support for **frustum**, **hemisphere**, and some other composite shapes.
- A **graphical version** of this program using C++ or Python.  
  _(I didnâ€™t do it in C++ or Python, but I did build an Android app in Kotlin based on the same idea! The APK attached to this repository is the app itself.)_

## Final thoughts

This might not be the cleanest or most scalable code Iâ€™ve ever written, but as a 9th grader, this was my first taste of building something from scratch. I used *everything* I knew, every trick I had, and every ounce of logic I could come up with.

That early UI design philosophy still stays with me and can be seen in my newer projects â€” except now, it's improved in terms of functionality, formatting, and overall user experience.
